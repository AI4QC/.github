# 👋 Hello world from AI for Physical Sciences Lab @ HKUST
 
Welcome to the official GitHub home of **AI4PhysSci Lab**, based at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)!

We are an interdisciplinary **AI for Science lab** aimming to build *Simulators*, *Emulators*, *Predictors*, and *Evaluators* for multiscale modeling workflows. 
Rooted in **AI x quantum x theoretical chemistry**, we have broad interests spanning **machine learning**, **quantum computing**,  **molecular simulation**,  **property prediction**, **generative molecular and material design** and **experiment design**. Our mission is to develop **useful, not just fancy** tools that revolutionize the paradigm of chemistry research & accelerate chemical discovery through the integration of data-driven models and physics-based principles.

## 🔬 What We Do

We build general, practical, and scalable tools to solve real-world scientific problems in chemistry. Our current efforts span:

- 🧠 **Deep Quantum Monte Carlo (Deep QMC)**: Wavefunction-based neural network solvers that deliver high-accuracy results for strongly correlated systems.
- 🧪 **Orbital-based learning**: Predicting physically constrained electron densities in real space.
- 🔍 **AI for material design**: Generative AI for material design problems.
- 🔬 **AI for experiment deisgn**: Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning tools for guided experimental design and scientific exploration.
- 🌐 **LLMs for Science**: Understanding and guiding the use of foundation models in scientific discovery.
